- 👋 Hi, I’m @mostly-wrong
- 👀 I’m interested in C because I started my journey with it in 1992, and I didn't get it then, but I just can't let it go, I have to learn how to code in C.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C because I'm stupid and I just like old stuff and don't want Rust to stop me from doing dumb shit that will teach me painfully.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and listen, because I'm back with a brand new edition...
- 📫 How to reach me, let's be honest, if you're looking at my code, you probably can't help me, and I definitely can't help you.
- 😄 Pronouns: are used in place of nouns that are already known or introduced earlier in the work, like variables.
- ⚡ Fun fact: In the word Mercedes, such as Mercedes Benz, none of the E's in it are pronounced the same way.
